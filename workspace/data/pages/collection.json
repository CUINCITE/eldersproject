They are activists who blazed trails for queer visibility and rights; they are ordinary people who have lived with extraordinary courage; they are witnesses to history, agents of change, and foreparents of today’s racial and queer justice movements. Their stories are inspiring, and essential to our understanding of who we are and might collectively become.",

Portland, the state’s largest city, is often called the “whitest big city in America”, shaped in part by its history as a sundown town. As the only free state in the Union with discriminatory clauses in its constitution, Oregon prohibited Black people from entering, owning property, and making contracts. Laws forbidding entry lasted until 1926 and fueled Ku Klux Klan activity, perpetuating systemic racism and leaving impacts on Black Oregonian life that last to this day.</p><p>In this collection, Renée Watson journeys through the lives and experiences of Black elders from in and around Portland, Oregon. Shaped by success, sorrow, discrimination, and kinship, their lives are set in a rocky, hardened landscape whose edges are softened by the communities they inhabit. Watson is a dutiful witness to these recollections, and we’re honored to hold these powerful stories in our collection</p>"
